    "author": "GifsModerator",
    "text": "# [New to reddit? Click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)\n\n#**.gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format submissions only, please!**\n\n#**Submissions cannot contain sound**\n\n**If there is a violation of the rules, *please* click the report button and leave a report, and also [message the moderator team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgifs) and report the problem if it requires more detail.**\n\n------------------\n\n1. **Please try not to repost.** Gifs that have been posted frequently or recently (**within the last 6 months**) to /r/gifs  will be deleted, and repeat offenders may be banned. This includes repeatedly removing and reposting your own submissions. \nCross-posting any very recent posts (**from within the last two weeks**) with a score higher than 1000 from other default subreddits will be counted as reposts. This includes popular video posts converted to gif and posted here. Please send us a modmail about videos that violate this rule, with a link to the video post and the /r/gifs post-- these are harder to catch and we appreciate your help.\n**[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  \n   \n *This rule is meant to keep things fresh. We do not have a hard and fast rule against reposts here, as some gifs have only been posted rarely and could benefit from another round. We also don't wish to discourage cross-posting in general (it's even encouraged by reddiquette), but if something was recently popular on other defaults, most everyone will have seen it already.*\n\n2. **No Reaction, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote gifs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)  \n   \n *The [/r/reactiongifs wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_a_reaction_gif.3F) explains this well. Just because a gif has a reaction in it doesn't make it a reaction gif.*\n\n3. **Do not post gifs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs *or content much better suited to video formats* will be removed.  **20 seconds maximum duration.** (This rule does not apply to comments)  \n   \n *If a converting a video to a gif makes the content lose a lot of context or effect, then it is better suited to video formats. Example: if hearing a conversation is required to fully understand/appreciate the content in the gif.*\n\n4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single gif image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!  \n  \n *Image/gallery pages are prone to malicious ads or editing in spam in the text areas, so we require direct linking to prevent this. URL shorteners are on reddit's site-wide spam filter, because you can hide anything in a URL shortener and people have no idea what their browser will open.*\n\n5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault in posts or comments.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.  \n\n6. **No witch-hunts or brigading in posts or comments.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments.  \n  \n *This includes trying to rile people up over another reddit user's activities. There are always many sides to everything, and we've seen reddit go after the wrong person many times.*\n\n7. ***Nudity, porn, gore, and other obscene material are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.*** Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. Please refer to /r/nsfw_gifs or /r/nsfw_gif. **Please mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.**  \n  \n *Risqué posts (girls in bikinis, for instance) are fine as long as it's tagged as NSFW and isn't overtly sexual. Porn, gore, nudity, and sex acts are bannable offenses in posts or comments. Anything causing grievous bodily harm or death is considered gore, even if there's no gore shown.*\n\n8. **Titles must be descriptive.** Do not make submissions with the title \"This\", \"This is my favorite gif\", etc.\n\n9. **No hate speech of any kind in posts or comments.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.  \n  \n *Making fun of or belittling any person or people based on race, sex, gender, sexual preference, disability, or other characteristics is likely to get you banned. Language that goes past the standard \"internet tough guy\" banter may result in a removal or ban, depending on the severity.*\n\n10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts or comments violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.\n\n---\n\n#**COMMENTS HAVE BEEN LOCKED FOR THIS POST!**\n\n If you have any questions about the rules, please [contact the moderators.]( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgifs)",
