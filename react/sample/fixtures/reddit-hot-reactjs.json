    "text": "I thought redux was supposed to help with this, from what i read [here](https://github.com/rackt/redux/issues/245) and [here](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) passing down actions directly is seen as 'not optimal'.\n\nHowever I have a structure like this\n\n    &lt;App&gt;\n         &lt;Header /&gt;\n         &lt;MainSection&gt;\n               &lt;ItemList&gt;\n                     &lt;Item&gt;\n                             &lt;ItemActions/&gt;\n                     &lt;/Item&gt;\n               &lt;/ItemList&gt;\n         &lt;/MainSection&gt;\n         &lt;Footer /&gt;\n    &lt;/App&gt;\n\nAnd I need to pass down actions all the way down to ItemActions .. the current pattern I see is to keep passing them down from component to component .. which is getting confusing at some point. Ideally I would want to hook the actions I need directly into ItemActions without taking them through all the tree .. anyone got any experience with this ?",

    "text": "So one of the things I keep seeing (and experienced myself back in the day) is that people like React, but all the *other* tools that come with it are a bit overwhelming.\n\nPersonally I use *way too many* tools, but I can see how it would make a lot more sense to learn React without them. So with this in mind, I've done a [write up](http://jamesknelson.com/learn-raw-react-no-jsx-flux-es6-webpack/) on using React without *any* tools (even JSX). I hope you find it useful, and I'd love to hear your thoughts (for example, would you use `React.createElement` differently to how I've used it)?\n\nAlso, since this is reddit and nobody is going to sign up for my mailing list *anyway*, heres the link to my [React cheatsheet](http://jamesknelson.com/react-cheatsheet.pdf) which people who sign up receive. *Feedback would be greatly appreciated!*",

    "text": "Hey guys. Getting myself familiar with React. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nFrom my limited understanding, I see React has a few lifecycle methods. One that I have been using in most of my pages is componentDidMount(). I'm using it to check if the user is authenticated on Facebook and hiding the login button if they are.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nSo far everything works great if you navigate between pages via the links. However if a user (that is authenticated already) goes from the index page to a settings page then presses the browser's back button they'll return to the index page but componentDidMount() doesn't fire, which means the function to check if they're authenticated never runs and the login button remains showing. Is there a lifecycle method or way around this problem?",
